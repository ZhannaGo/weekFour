/*
we have a situation where the value of x gets copied into the argument a, so that a is now 3. And we return a + 1, Now there is no storage for a + 1, so temporary variable gets created with value a + 1. And that temporary variable now gets copied into r, and we exit the function, and everything inside now disappeares. Scope of a is just inside of the function. And now it is gone and r has the value 4. Notice that often variables come to existance and  going out of existance.
